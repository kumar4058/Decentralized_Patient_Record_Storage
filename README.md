## To Store Patient Record in Ethereum Blockchain

### Running a Smart Contract on Remix

To run a smart contract on Remix, an online Ethereum Solidity development environment, you need several prerequisites in place. Here are the key requirements:

1. **Web Browser**: You should have a modern web browser installed on your computer. Remix is a web-based IDE, and it works best with browsers like Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Microsoft Edge. Ensure that your browser is up-to-date.

2. **Internet Connection**: Since Remix is an online IDE, you need a stable internet connection to access and use it.

3. **Solidity Smart Contract**: You should have a Solidity smart contract that you want to compile and deploy. You can create a new contract in Remix or import an existing one.

4. **Metamask or Web3 Provider**: If you plan to deploy your contract to a real Ethereum network (mainnet or a testnet), you will need a cryptocurrency wallet with Ether to pay for gas fees. Metamask is a popular choice for this purpose. Alternatively, you can connect Remix to a local development blockchain using Ganache or Hardhat, which doesn't require a wallet or real Ether.

5. **Metamask Extension**: If you're using Metamask, ensure that the Metamask browser extension is installed and set up in your web browser.

6. **Ethereum Network**: If you're deploying to a real Ethereum network, ensure that you're connected to the desired network (e.g., Ethereum Mainnet, Ropsten, Rinkeby, or a local development network) in Metamask or your web3 provider.

7. **Compiler Version**: Verify that Remix supports the Solidity compiler version you're using. Remix typically supports a range of Solidity compiler versions, and you can select the desired version in the Remix settings.

8. **Smart Contract Dependencies**: If your smart contract relies on external libraries or dependencies, make sure you import or link those dependencies in your Remix project.

9. **Plugin Installation (Optional)**: Depending on your project's requirements, you might need to install specific Remix plugins or extensions to enhance your development experience.

10. **Understanding of Solidity and Ethereum**: It's essential to have a basic understanding of Solidity, Ethereum, smart contracts, and how transactions work on the Ethereum network.
