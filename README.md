# To Store Patient Record in Ethereum Blockchain

To run a smart contract on Remix, an online Ethereum Solidity development environment, you need several prerequisites in place. Here are the key requirements:

Web Browser: You should have a modern web browser installed on your computer. Remix is a web-based IDE, and it works best with browsers like Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Microsoft Edge. Ensure that your browser is up-to-date.

Internet Connection: Since Remix is an online IDE, you need a stable internet connection to access and use it.

Solidity Smart Contract: You should have a Solidity smart contract that you want to compile and deploy. You can create a new contract in Remix or import an existing one.

Metamask or Web3 Provider: If you plan to deploy your contract to a real Ethereum network (mainnet or a testnet), you will need a cryptocurrency wallet with Ether to pay for gas fees. Metamask is a popular choice for this purpose. Alternatively, you can connect Remix to a local development blockchain using Ganache or Hardhat, which doesn't require a wallet or real Ether.

Metamask Extension: If you're using Metamask, ensure that the Metamask browser extension is installed and set up in your web browser.

Ethereum Network: If you're deploying to a real Ethereum network, ensure that you're connected to the desired network (e.g., Ethereum Mainnet, Ropsten, Rinkeby, or a local development network) in Metamask or your web3 provider.

Compiler Version: Verify that Remix supports the Solidity compiler version you're using. Remix typically supports a range of Solidity compiler versions, and you can select the desired version in the Remix settings.

Smart Contract Dependencies: If your smart contract relies on external libraries or dependencies, make sure you import or link those dependencies in your Remix project.

Plugin Installation (Optional): Depending on your project's requirements, you might need to install specific Remix plugins or extensions to enhance your development experience.

Understanding of Solidity and Ethereum: It's essential to have a basic understanding of Solidity, Ethereum, smart contracts, and how transactions work on the Ethereum network.
